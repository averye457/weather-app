A web app designed to display weather in a an appealing and interactive way. This project was built as a part of my project for Code Louisville ([codelouisville.org](https://codelouisville.org/)) for completion of the 'Javascript with React.js' course.  


This app displays weather for Today, a forecast for the next 3 days, or even a 7 day forecast. This app was built using the Javascript framework React.
